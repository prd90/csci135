    "We talked about **conditionals** and **functions** to help make programs more useful.  However, one of the things that makes programs really useful is the ability to use repetition to complete the same or a similar task over a large amount of data.  For example, if you have 50,000 lines in a spreadsheet, you can either spend a week typing changes by hand or create a Python program which does it in a very short time!  The code to do repetitive task is called a **loop**.  There are several ways to do loops in Python.  Consider the following code.\n",

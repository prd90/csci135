When you define a dictionary, you create **key**/**value** pairs.  A **value** is always accessed with its **key**.  Dictionaries are defined with { }, but again indexed with [ ].

    "In the slides for this week’s lecture we talk about nested dictionaries.  This seems like a small topic, but it’s a very important one.  A lot of students who learn programming tend to think of data structures as one level.   For example, if you have three pieces of data, you might store them as:\n",

    " \n",
    "But that is not always the best way.  In fact, it’s often much more important to use a more complex, nested data structure.  This gives you a lot of options to manage the data.  Let’s look at the previous list of the three lists.  What if you need to sort the lists into a certain order?   You can sort one list, but now the other items don’t match.  You could take the time to write a complex sorting algorithm to track how the indices changes and then reorder the other two lists, but that’s unnecessary.  If you used something like this:\n",

    "![Nested Data Structure](images/Dict-1.jpg)\n",

    "\n",
    "The other thing that’s important to remember is that lists and dictionaries allow ANY type of value to in the list/dictionary.  This is also often overlooked by beginning students.  You may be creating objects from a library and those objects can go into a list.  You may have a set of functions you have created and those can be assigned to a list.  Once there, you can use the power of lists or dictionaries to use them.\n",

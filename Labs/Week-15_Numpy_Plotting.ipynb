    "### Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a very flexible and powerful language, but one thing that makes it even more powerful are the additional libraries that are freely available.  One of the most used libraries is **numpy**.  This is used for numerical calculations and has very fast routines that implement a wide range of numerical functions.  This library is required by many, many third-party libraries in Python, including **matplotlib**, which we will also be using in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/NP-1.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy** implements a new type in python called ***ndarray***.  These are similar in some ways to Python lists but are closer to classical arrays. **Numpy** arrays have advantages in that they are much more compact (take less space) and are much faster to use.  In addition, unlike Python lists the array will be allocated in one consecutive block of memory.  This is important for some applications.   The price for all these features in that, unlike Python lists, numpy arrays can only ever contain one type of data (integer floating point, etc.).  This data type is determined at the ***ndarray*** creation time.  The data types for numpy are also more detailed than in Python as you can select not only the basic type, but the storage size of the value (8, 16, 32, or 64-bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is important to note that in order to use **numpy** functions, you need to import the **numpy** library. For our lab, we will import the **numpy** library with the name ***np***.  The reasons for this is that is the way alsmot all the documentation and examples you find on the Internet do as well.  In fact when Googling for **numpy** functions, you get the best results using the prefix \"np.\"  In the code cell enter the following:\n",

    "Of course, you there are also multiple functions in numpy to create arrays without needing a Python data structure.  Each one of the functions takes an argument which is a **tuple** with the **shape** (dimensions) of the array.  **Shape** is term numpy uses for the dimensions/layout of the array.  If you want a single dimensional array, you would specify the number of elements with one number, like ***(12)*** – in this case there will be twelve places in the array along a single axis (or dimension).  Higher numbers of dimensions are specified with more values in the tuple (e.g. ***(3,3,2)*** ).  The main functions to create arrays are:\n",

    "***np.empty()*** – Creates an array which has uninitialized values. Each value will start with whatever was in that memory location prior to allocation.  This is generally not recommended.\n",

    "The reason that did not work is due the fact that Python needs to know what code to run if the conditional is true and where to skip down to if it is not true.  It does by using **code blocks**.  An *if* requires its own **code block**.  A **code block** in Python is indicated by the indention of the line.  You may remember earlier in the course, we discussed that you cannot use leading spaces (or tabs) randomly in Python and this is why.  A new code block is indicated by a different indent level between the preceding code and/or the following code.   Here’s a working example for the **if** statement.  Fix your program to look like the following and try it again:\n",

    "Notice in the previous example, the ***if*** contains a code block with two lines.  A code block can be one or more lines and there is no limit.   Also look more carefully at the indention.  In preparing this lab, I used a tab for each line, but you may have used spaces.  Which is correct?  Well, Python will accept either, it does not matter.  What is *very important* is that whatever you use is consistent.  You can’t switch back and forth in the same code block and it also needs to be the same number of spaces and tabs inside a code block.  This use of leading indents is to save space and typing by not having to have a lot of extra symbols or syntax to mark code blocks, but can be tricky as you need to mind where the various levels of idents are for your code blocks.\n",

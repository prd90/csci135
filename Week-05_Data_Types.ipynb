    "###  Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we talked about objects in Python.  It is tempting to think of variables and objects as being the same thing, but it is important to remember the difference. One important difference is that all variables can be changed to point to different objects, but not all objects can have their values changed.  In fact, many objects cannot be changed once they are created.  Whether or not an object can be changed is the concept of **mutability**.  Although all this seems like a trivial detail, it will really matter in understanding how Python behaves later in this course and into CSCI-145.  So, what is mutability?  It is related to the concept of objects that we talked about last week in Variables and Expressions.  Start with the following code we also tried last week:\n",

    "###  Data Type Conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have gone through a lot of different data types in this lab.  One of the convenient things in Python is that you can convert data types other data types. There are built-in conversion functions (e.g. ***int()***, ***str()***, ***float()***) to do this.  One important thing to note is that Python will try to make conversions for you as needed, but it does so using a certain set of rules.  This means Python may not automatically convert things the way you want them converted, so it  recommended that you do explicit conversions (using the conversion functions) so that you know exactly what is happening in your code.  Try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "i = 9\n",
    "print(i)\n",
    "f=float(i)\n",
    "print(f)\n",
    "s=str(f)\n",
    "print(s)\n",
    "```"

    "One important thing to remember about using explicit conversions is that whatever you are trying to convert has to make sense as the new type.  For example, if you convert a string \"123\" to an integer value, that makes sense, while trying to convert a string \"xyz\" does not make sense as an integer value.  Try the following code:\n",

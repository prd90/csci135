    "Python is commonly used to analyze data. This is an example of doing just that. The U.S. Social Security Administration publishes lists of baby names for every year since 1880. This is a large amount of data is publicly available in a series of files. For this assignment, a portion of the data has been merged into a single smaller file. The data is stored in a *CSV (comma separated values)* file as discussed in the lecture and the lab.  The file is a list of baby names, with each line of the format:\n",
    "\n",
    "Year,Name,Gender(M/F),Number\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Number* is the number of children given the *Name* in that *Year*. Each line in the file is in the proper format (so you don't need to check for errors/missing data) and all duplicates have been removed (so you don't have to worry about that either). Please note that although there is no duplicate names in the same year for the same gender, the same name can be used twice (once for female and once for male).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to create a program, with comments to document what you are doing, to provide information from this file:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we will be using the data from the years 1990-2010 only.  You can disregard any other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file name is name_data.csv and is provided for you (you only need to open it and read/use the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask the user for a menu option for a function, the options are:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1 - Total names for a given year - where you will print out the total count of the all the names in the file for the chosen year  (see example below)<br/>\n",
    ">2 - Print all names for a given year, along with the number of times they were used that year - where you will print out, one per line (see example below), a list of names and the number of times they were used (this is the Name and Number fields in the file)<br/>\n",
    ">3 - How many name entries for that year in the file - where you will print out the count of the number of entries in the file for the chosen year  (see example below)<br />\n",
    ">q - Quit<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provided provides the menu of options for your convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The program will ask for an option for the the function wanted, but you need to check the menu choice entered by the user fto make sure it is valud and handle errors without the program crashing.  When you get an invalid input for a menu choice, just keep asking for a menu option until you get a valid answer. There is no need to to reprint the menu after a user input error, just ask for a choice again.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  You will ask the user for a single year from 1990-2010.  You need to check for invalid entries and keep asking until you get a valid one.\n",

    "### FINAL NOTES:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easiest to get the solution by building the program incrementally. Work on one part and then add additional parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the the programs will may be tested with other years than in the examples above to insure that they work properly. Partial credit will be given where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT #1: You don't necessarily have to use the csv library referenced in the class (but you can if you want). Remember you can split a string with comma separated values. If you have a string called entry, you can say **entry.split(',')** and that will return a list of each entry (with no commas).\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT #2: If you use a dictionary in any part of your program (and there are many ways to do this without using dictionaries), there is a way you can get the *key* for the highest dictionary *value*. If your dictionary name is entry, the call **max(entry,key=entry.get)** will return the *key* associated with the maximum *value*."

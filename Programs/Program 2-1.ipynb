    "This program prints characters to form the shape of a downward pointing arrow composed of a rectangle shape and a right triangle shape (see example below). \n",
    "\n",
    "The arrow dimensions are defined by values for base height (bh), base width (bw), and head width (hw).  You should prompt the user to input these values.  The base width (bw) defines the number of characters on a line for the base part of the arrow.  The base height (bh) is the number of lines to print for the arraow base.  The head width (hw) specifies the number of characters to print on the first line of the arrow head.  Each subsequent line will have one less characters.  Some examples of the variable values are:\n",
